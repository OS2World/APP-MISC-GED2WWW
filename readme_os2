This is the unmodified version of GED2WWW 0.31 recompiled for OS/2.
The original was distributed under the terms of the the GNU
General Public License (GPL).

The directory src contains all the original source files plus the
modified makefile, and will be required only if a rebuild is desired.
I also included a sample gedcom file test.ged to test the program.

To execute this program and rebuild the sample html files in the
"html" subdirectory type "ged2www" and follow the prompts.
